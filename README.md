# Personal Scoop Bucket

This is my own versions of manifests for [Scoop](https://scoop.sh), the Windows command-line installer.

Mostly a testing ground before moving any changes over to the main bucket.

How do I install these manifests?
---------------------------------

Just `scoop install <manifest>`. This is the default bucket for Scoop and is added by default.
